# mehemken's .vimrc

Check it out, copy it, and if you have suggestions, let [me](http://mehemken.io) know!

I've been using vim since mid 2016. It's changed my life. I live in the command line now. All other text editors are now useless to me. Except leafpad. Sometimes I use it to make copy pasting easier. IDEs are a different story. I don't use them but I think that's because of the nature of my hobby projects.

# Bonus points

If you're privisioning a new EC2 instance or similar, and you find yourself in a tough spot with an unconfigured Vim... have no fear. Do this:

    curl mehemken.io/vim > ~/.vimrc

Bam! You've got yourself a sweet vimrc.
